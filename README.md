# SecondStepTo-DSA  

Welcome to **SecondStepTo-DSA**! This repository documents my journey as I revisit and practice fundamental concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Through this, I aim to sharpen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of these core topics.  

## Contents  

1. **Data Structures**  
    - Arrays  
    - Linked Lists  
    - Stacks  
    - Queues  
    - Trees  
    - Graphs  
    - Hash Maps and Hash Tables  

2. **Algorithms**  
    - Searching and Sorting  
    - Recursion and Backtracking  
    - Dynamic Programming  
    - Greedy Algorithms  
    - Graph Algorithms  
    - Divide and Conquer  

3. **Problem-Solving Practice**  
    - Problems from platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com), and more.
